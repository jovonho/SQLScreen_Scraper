- Tried parsing the page using python requests. The server notices we don't have javascript enabled and refuses to serve the content.

5 Nov 2020:
- Tried using requests_html which can render the javascript but this also failed.
- Looking at the page's requests, it queries the tmx graphql API to fetch all the stock information. 
  I tried to recreate this call but received a 405 not allowed exception. 
- Scratch that, I'm dumb as shit, I was POSTing to the wrong url. 
  IT WORKS!
- We can get quote information for the day as well as timeseries information in given minute intervals for a daterange in unix timestamps
-- 6 months of data in 60min intervals weighs 218KB
-- 1 yr of data in 30min intervals is about 1 MB --> 4.8 GB for 1 yr of each stock. 
--- Could also dynamically fetch    

TODO:
- Find a good timeseries database!
- Implement Proper Logging
